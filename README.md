## Heyyy 👋
I'm Mackenzie, a Software Engineering student located in Louisiana. 
I am completing the second semester of my sophomore year at LSU.
I love to learn new languages and applications to better understand which ones I like and gravitate more towards. Udemy has a lot of engaging classes I've been using.
Participating in the GeauxHack 2025 at LSU has furthered my journey in developing, especially since we got 2nd place :).

🌱 I’m currently learning Python and HTML
